## Why I Made It and What I Learned

- Why:
    - I created this game to practice my skills in JavaScript.
- What I learned:
    - In creating this game, I familiarized myself with the functionality of:
        - for loops
        - while loops
        - if/elseif/else statements
        - prompt(), alert(), and confirm() functions in JavaScript
        - conditional operators such as strict equality ===, or ||, and &&
        - defining functions
        - global vs. local scope
